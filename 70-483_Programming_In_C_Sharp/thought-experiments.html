                            <li>A time-out can be established by providing a timeout value to TryEnter which tries to

                            <li>This only works correctly if the task that is causing the deadlock is checking its

                            <li>TL:DR; Yes it's possible, it just entails a lot of extra work. The best way to avoid

            <h3 id="c1-s5">5 Exceptions</h3>
            <p>Exceptions are an important part of application development. At the very least an application will have
                to
                handle exceptions that may be produced by .NET methods that it uses. For a large application you may
                have to
                design custom exception types and create an error handling strategy that manages how exceptions are
                propagted and managed. It is important to put exceptions in the correct perspective; any error that you
                would expect the system to deal with in the normal course of events should not be handled by the use of
                an
                exception, they should be reserved for situations where it is not meaningful for the application to
                continue.</p>
            <p>Here are some questions to consider:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="question-answer">
                    <div class="question">Is a method receiving a date of "31st of February" something that should cause
                        an
                        exception.</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <ul>
                            <li>It depends on the context of the action.</li>
                            <li>If the date is being entered by a user it is reasonable to display an error message and
                                request that the date be re-entered.</li>
                            <li>If the date is being supplied by a method that is expected to create a transaction with
                                this
                                date, it is reasonable for that method to throw an exception if given an invalid date,
                                as it
                                wouldn't be meaningful for the method to generate anything.</li>
                            <li>Throwing an exception, rather than returning an error code or a null value, is a way of
                                ensuring that the program will fail in a properly noticeable way and maximizes the
                                chances
                                of the mistake being detected.</li>
                            <li>From a design perspective, the need for exceptions in this situation would be completely
                                removed if the method creating the trasaction was passed a DateTime structure. This can
                                only
                                contain a valid date.</li>

                            <li>You should catch all the exceptions that you know how to deal with.</li>
                            <li>Let the remaining ones pass through so they are either caught by layers above or
                                propagate
                                as errors which can be caught and dealt with.</li>

            <p>There comes a point in application construction where the data storage for the application must be
                designed. At this point you need to map data items onto C# data types. Each data item will be mapped
                onto an object that may be manged by value or reference. State information can be mapped onto enumerated
                types for which yuo can set a range of allowed values.</p>
            <p>Here are some questions to consider:</p>
            <ol>

                            <li>If you want to handle different types of employee then a reference would be better.</li>
                            <li>Reference types will make it much easier to index and sort your employee records.</li>
                            <li>Structures are best suited to small value types, which you may want to make immutable.

                            <li>Using structures to hold the data would be a good idea if the numbers of data items is

            <p>Once you have established types that your program will use, you will have to write code to manipulate the
                types. This frequently means that the program will have to convert values from one type to another, and
                sometiems a program will have to interact with external services which do not have type information that
                can be used by the C# compiler to perform static analysis to establish the correctness of an
                interaction.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Boxing is the name given to the action of converting a value type into a reference type.
                            </li>
                            <li>It is performed when we need to work with a value as an object, perhaps to allow the
                                value to be inserted in a data structure that is managed by reference.</li>
                            <li>A program will spend a lot of its time just manipuklating values, and the use of
                                reference types will significantly slow down this process.</li>
                            <li>You can run a program using only interface types that provide the object implemtations
                                of value types, but this would run a lot more slowly than one that used value types.

                            <li>Each type conversion method is assigned a "target" type, and so it would be possible for
                                an object to have a type conversion to multiple types.</li>
                            <li>In these situations it's recommended to use properties to return a value from a type,
                                rather than using casting and type conversion methods.</li>

                            <li>You can write a program that uses entirely dynamic types.</li>
                            <li>It should always compile since the compiler will not perform any static error checking.

                            <li>However, it would probably fail quite frequently too, as mistakes that would normally

            <p>Encapsulation is a powerful technqiue. It allows developers to hide the implementation of an object and
                control precisely how code outside the object will interact with it. It also means that develoerps can
                change the internal design of an object without affecting any of the users of that object.</p>
            <p>Here are some questions to consider:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>There are 2 ways that an object can encapsulate data values: via porperties, or via
                                getter and setter methods.</li>
                            <li>Properties are very easy ways for code to interact with encapsulated values, as they're
                                assigned and read in the same way as public data values.</li>
                            <li>There is no difference in performance between properties and get/set methods.</li>
                            <li>The compiler generates get and set methods when properties are compiled.</li>
                            <li>However, get and set methods are slightly more flexible, in that a set method can
                                perform validation on an input value and return a result which indicates whether an
                                input value has been set correct.</li>
                            <li>The set behaviour can also perform validation, but the set behaviour cannot return a
                                status value.</li>

                            <li>An extreme form of encapsulation is the creation of immutable objects.</li>

            <p>The starting point for a class hierarchy should not be the design of the base class of the heirarchy, but
                the creation of an interface that expresses the behaviours of this base class. Using an interface from
                the start of your design process allows a great deal of flexibility in that objects can be regarded in
                terms of their abilitie, not their particular type. You can still use a class hierarchy to reduce the
                amount of code that your have to write, by creating child classes that inherit methods from their
                parents and only override the one that need to provide behaviours specific to the child.F</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>An interface specifies a set of behaviours that an objet must provide so that it can be
                                referred to by a reference of the interface type.</li>
                            <li>This provides a lot of flexibility, for example a list of interface references could
                                contain any type of object, as long as that type implemeneted the interface.</li>
                            <li>An abstract type is more restrictive. It contains a set of behaviours that an object
                                must provide, but the object can only then be regarded in terms of the abstract types,
                                not in any other way.</li>

            <p>This skill involves the use of code to work with code. You can improve your development process by adding
                attribute information to objects and behaviours in the program. You can create programs that dynamically
                configure their components by searching for code elements that have a particular set of behaviours as
                defined in an interface. You can also use code to create more code, automatically producing complete
                classes, which can be converted into program source or a compiled assembly. You can also create
                expression trees that can be converted into executable methods.</p>

            <p>The automatic garbage collection enjoyd by C# develoeprs is built on carefully written and highly
                developed foundations. However, the non-deterministic nature of garbage collection process (you can't
                always be sure precisely when an object will be removed from memory) means that programmers must
                exercise care when working with objects taht contain references to resources that are to be shared with
                other objects. The IDisposable interface provides a way that programmers can enforce a more managed
                approach to resource management.</p>
            <p>Here are some questions to consider:</p>

                            <li>This means creating and destroying types such as integer, float and double will not make

                            <li>However, if the value type is a struct, and the struct contains reference types, it will
                                create work for the garbage collector, as the objects inside the structure will need to

            <p>Successive version of C# have added more and more string manipulation abilities to the language and its

                code to perform string processing. I strongly advise you to check out the abilities of the string type
                and the libraries that work with it before you start to write custom code to work with strings.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Interning of strings takes place when the compiler notices the same string literal is
                                assigned to multiple variables in the program source.</li>
                            <li>The compiler makes a single "interned" variable that contains the string literal and all
                                the variables assigned that literal are made to refer to a single value.</li>
                            <li>At tun time this has the advantage that the program may be able to compare strings more
                                quickly because two string variables will be equal if they both refer to the same
                                interned object.</li>
                            <li>The only disadvantage of interning is that it slows down the compilation process.</li>

            <p>Programs fail in response to invalid data. It is a situation where the user of the program looks clever
                and the developer looks stupid. However, there is more to validation thatn looking stupid; a failure to
                pay attention to this issue can lead to the creation of applicaitons that are vulnerable to exploits
                that can be initiated just by entering some invalid values.</p>

            <p>Secure storage and transfer of data is a vital aspect of application development. It is important to
                understand the principles that underpin the process, in particular the differences between symmetric and
                asymmetric encryption, and how asymmetric encryption enables public/private keys.</p>

            <p>Assemblies are the fundamental building blocks of .NEt applicaitons. Classes allow you to break your

                files that will be deployed to users of your application. It goes without saying that the contents of
                each assembly need to be considered during the design phase of your application.</p>

            <p>The true value of diagnostics only becomes apparent once you hit a problem with an application that has
                been deployed to users. In this situation it is incredibly useful to have detailed descriptive output
                and the ability to view the path followed by your code. Adding tracing and logging elements to your
                applications has other benefits too, in that it makes debugging significantly easier, and the tracing
                outputs can be incorporated into a test-driven design. And, debugging can be completely omitted from the
                final program if required.</p>

            <p>Class hierarchies are an important element in the design of the data management mechanisms provided by
                .NET. The Stream class sets out the fundamental data movement commands and is used as the basis of
                classes that provide data storage on a variety of platforms. Streams can also be chained together so
                that character encoding, encryption and compression can be performed on data being moved to or from any
                stream-base store.</p>

            <p>LINQ allows developers to take their SQL skills in building queries and apply them to software objects.
                By exposing query elements as C# operators using the query comprehension syntax LINQ allows you to
                create C# statements that closely resemble SQL queries. These queries can be applied to structured data
                from a database, but they can also be applied to normal collections and XML documents. LINQ is useful
                for filtering data and extracting subsets; it also provides the group operator that can be used to
                summarize data. LINQ queries are actually implemented as method calls onto objects and can be created
                that way if preferred.</p>

                            <li>The LINQ operators allow the programmer to express thei intent directly without having

                            <li>The compiler converts "query comprehension" notation queries into chains of method

            <p>Serialization is very useful when you want to store or transfer structured data. It is susceptible to
                problems if the content or arrangement of data items that have been serialized change in later versions
                of an application. But, it is possible with sensible data design.</p>
            <p>Here are some questions to consider:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="question-answer">
                    <div class="question">When should you use serialization in your program?</div>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It's very useful when storing small amounts of structured data.</li>
                            <li>The highscore table for a game can be stored as a serialized object.</li>
                            <li>It would be less sensible to store large data strcutures as serialized objects,
                                particularly if the object has to be repeatedly updated.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class="question-answer">
                    <div class="question">Do you need a copy of the type to read a serialized object?</div>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Serialization takes a snapshot of the data elemnts in a particular type.</li>
                            <li>During the deserialization process a new instance of the serialized type is created.
                                This process requires the type to be deserialzied to be available on the receiving
                                machine.</li>
                            <li>With binary serialization, the binary file contains type information that is compared
                                with type information in the destination class. If this information doesn't match, the
                                deserialization fails.</li>
                            <li>In XML and JSON serialization, this matching does not take place. These types can be
                                regarded as more portable, at the expense of security.</li>
                            <li>The DataContract serialization process allows the serialized object to contain type
                                information that can be checked during deserialization, but the format of the serialized
                                file is still human readable XML.</li>

                                will be serialized and the programmer must mark as NonSerialized any data members that
                                should not be serialized.</li>

            <p>Collections provided by .NET can be thought of as a set of tools. Each tool suited to a particular
                situation. Most of the time storage demands are met by List or Dictionary types, but there are
                occassions when a queue or set can save a lot of work. Extending a parent collection type is a great way
                to add custom behaviours. It is possible to perform LINQ queries on collections, which can save a lot of
                work writing code to search through them.</p>
